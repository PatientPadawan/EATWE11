# EATWE11:
An interactive web app that allows users to enter information regarding height, weight, etc. and uses said information in the Mifflin St. Jeor calculation
to get a rough estimate of the user's total daily energy expenditure(TDEE). From there the app makes a call to a database to procure recipes that fit within the
specified TDEE range. The recipes themselves are displayed and have shoppable functionality.
